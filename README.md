### 🌸 Project Overview
This project focuses on the creation of a serene, procedurally-enhanced Japanese Garden. It serves as a study in **3D modeling, lighting, and environmental rendering**.

The scene incorporates iconic elements such as Torii gates, stone lanterns (Tōrō), and cherry blossoms, utilizing custom shaders to achieve a tranquil, atmospheric aesthetic.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dynamic Lighting:** Implementation of Phong/Blinn-Phong lighting models for realistic shadows and reflections.
* **Environmental Texturing:** Custom-mapped textures for wood, stone, and foliage.
* **Camera Navigation:** Interactive first-person or orbital camera controls to explore the garden.
* **Atmospheric Effects:** Skybox integration and fog effects to simulate a peaceful morning mist.

## 🛠️ Technical Breakdown
The project demonstrates mastery over the standard graphics pipeline:

1.  **Vertex Processing** 📐: Handling complex 3D meshes for traditional architecture.
2.  **Fragment Shading** 🎨: Custom GLSL shaders for material properties and light attenuation.
3.  **Buffer Management** 💾: Efficient use of VBOs, VAOs, and EBOs for optimized rendering.
4.  **Transformation Matrices** 🔄: Precise control over Model-View-Projection (MVP) matrices.
